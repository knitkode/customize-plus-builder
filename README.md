> Building Theme options for the WordPress Customizer has never been easier.


Free vs Premium
---------------
Customize Plus Builder comes in **two versions**:
* ‎a *free* [standalone static web application](https://knitkode.com/customize-plus-builder)
* ‎a *premium* [WordPress plugin](https://knitkode.com/products/customize-plus-builder)

The two versions have the same functionalities in regards to building a [customizer tree](https://knitkode.com/customize-plus-builder#customizer-tree) and are always updated at the same time. Their difference is that only with the WordPress plugin you can save, edit and manage your [customizer trees](https://knitkode.com/customize-plus-builder#tree-manager) in the WordPress installation of your choice. This gives you the freedom and comfortableness of build and tweak, update and release your customizer trees step by step.
